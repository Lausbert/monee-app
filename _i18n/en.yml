    - title: "Great app!!"
      body: "Apart from the fact that a household ledger is a super-useful and important thing, I think the developer has scored a real coup with Monee! It’s clearly laid out, intuitive and easy to use, all the essential functions are included and of course there’s an analysis of income and expenses. I don’t need any other app anymore… and the whole thing is completely free and ad-free. Respect and many thanks to the developer!!!"

      body: "I used another app to record my expenses for six years and switched to this one a few weeks ago: it’s far prettier, leaner, more modern and much easier to use. And in today’s update the developer even fulfilled my wish to be able to use the app solo. ❤️ I’m absolutely thrilled! 🙏🏻🤩 The app is fantastic and the developer responds very quickly to questions. Top!"

You can automate recurring expenses or income, add categories and later filter everything so you know exactly how much you’ve spent in any given category. You can really see the effort behind it!"

After several failed attempts, Monee was the first free, clear program. I can reassign or delete mis-categorized items afterward, which was very important to me. I’ve only been using it for a week and hope everything stays just as it is."
